# About 

Greetings Everyone! My name is Daniel Caldwell! I'm a Computer Science student at Marymount University in Arlington, VA. Welcome to my blog! My primary interests are data analytics, swimming, and reading. This blog is generally for tech-related writeups and blog posts, however I may occasionally post about other topics.

While you're here, go ahead and check out some of my work!
